<h1>Introduction</h1>
HEY!This is TuneTools! This is a website for song lovers to explore and rate good music! We feature albums , artists and their top charts!. This project (at completion) aims to be a fully fledged
IMDB for your songs.This project was taken up by two Music connoiseurs Divyansh and Sanchit.We came up with the name TuneTools because this site will serve as a 'tool' for your favorite tunes.
And for the punchline of our page :P. This was a pathetic result of our obsession with Stranger things and how accurately the punchline sits with the theme of our website.


<h1>The look:</h1>
We decided to go with a minimalist theme for the website primarily with black green and white to give the site an aesthetic look.We have a navbar which serves as your go-to to the various pages of
the website. There is a footer at the end which can take you to home and about page and also has our names :).

<h1> Page designing </h1>
Our pages were designed all thanks to CSS in html and other basic commands of HTML,CSS.Flexbox stands out because of its immense versatility and use in styling our pages.We also used a lot of 
CSS transition effects to give a more responsive feel to the page.

<h1>The structure</h1>
Our project consists of a homepage , an about page , page for artists and albums.
The internal structure of this site consists of a homepage , artist page , relevant images and then a subdirectory for each artist.

<h2>This is how the structure of the repository looks like:</h2>
