<h1>Assumptions used while designing ToolsTune</h1>

-The site will be opened in Google Chrome in a standard display of around 13-16 inches at 1920X1080 resolution at 100% display size. Opening otherwise wont give any error but the best layout will be achieved under given settings.<br>
-The Spotlight page is designed to feature an emerging artist every month as per personal creativity to improve the utilitiy of the Website in live scenarios.<br>
-Some images may not be rendered because they have been picked from the internet.<br>
-There are only 6 artists featured at the moment because of time constraints. But the artist page can easily contain more artists with just 2-3 lines of change.<br>

-Most hover effects achieved were through CSS except the navbar as per the project requirements.
