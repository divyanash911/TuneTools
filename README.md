HEY !This is TuneTools! This is a website for song lovers to explore and rate good music! We feature albums , artists and their top charts!. This project (at completion) aims to be a fully fledged IMDB for your songs.This project was taken up by two Music connoiseurs Divyansh and Sanchit.We came up with the name TuneTools because this site will serve as a 'tool' for your favorite tunes.
And for the punchline of our page :P. This was a pathetic result of our obsession with Stranger things and how accurately the punchline sits with the theme of our website.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
The following python modules must be preinstalled for the website to be properly functional:
-Flask
-flask_cors
-jsonify
-json
-request

We tested the code with python3 and sqlite3 on Ubuntu.The HTML pages were opened on port 5500 of the localhost.


<h1>The look:</h1>
We decided to go with a minimalist theme for the website primarily with black green and white to give the site an aesthetic look.We have a navbar which serves as your go-to to the various pages of
the website. There is a footer at the end which can take you to home and about page and also has our names :).

<h1> Page designing </h1>
Our pages were designed all thanks to CSS in html and other basic commands of HTML,CSS.Flexbox stands out because of its immense versatility and use in styling our pages.We also used a lot of 
CSS transition effects to give a more responsive feel to the page.

<h1>Back-End</h1>
We used JS and Flask for the backend along with SQLlite for complete end to end deployment from interface to server to database. We created APIs with POST and GET requests to feed and retrieve data and display dynamically on the page using JS.

<h1>The structure</h1>
Our project consists of a homepage , an about page , page for artists and albums , a spotlight Page featuring an emerging artist in the music Domain , a search bar powered by ITunes API and a dedicated playlist page for the user to add and remove songs


<h2>This is how the structure of the repository looks like:</h2>

The Pages directory contains all the relevant pages.


<h1>Accessing our page</h1>
To open our website you need to open the html document named "homepage.html"  and "app.py" found in "Pages" directory. All other pages are accesible from the same.
Otherwise it is easier to open the project web-warriors-Phase-3 folder in terminal and run the following command

bash start.sh

(In case it doesnt work you need to start app.py and homepage.html in Pages directory)
Hassle free!Enjoy TuneTools!
You can start app.py using the command python3 app.py and homepage.html is in Pages directory..
